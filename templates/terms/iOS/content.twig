				<p class="lb-descriptions">By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you
					– you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You&rsquo;re not
					allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You&rsquo;re
					not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn&rsquo;t try to
					translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the
					trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still
					belong to Ivan Lobanov.</p>
				<p class="lb-descriptions">Ivan Lobanov is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient
					as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its
					services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services
					without making it very clear to you exactly what you&rsquo;re paying for.</p>
				<p class="lb-descriptions">The LinkBridge app stores and processes personal data that you have provided
					to us, to provide my Service. It&rsquo;s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the
					app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the
					process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system
					of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
					compromise your phone&rsquo;s security features, and it could mean that the LinkBridge app won&rsquo;t
					work properly or at all.</p>
				<p class="lb-descriptions">You should be aware that there are certain things that Ivan Lobanov will not
					take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active
					internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but
					Ivan Lobanov cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don&rsquo;t
					have access to Wi-Fi, and you don&rsquo;t have any of your data allowance left.</p>
				<p class="lb-descriptions">If you&rsquo;re using the app outside an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember
					that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you
					may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while
					accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you&rsquo;re accepting
					responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside your
					home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill
					payer for the device on which you&rsquo;re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you
					have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>
				<p class="lb-descriptions">Along the same lines, Ivan Lobanov cannot always take responsibility for the
					way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
					battery, and you can&rsquo;t turn it on to avail the Service, Ivan Lobanov cannot accept
					responsibility.</p>
				<p class="lb-descriptions">With respect to Ivan Lobanov&rsquo;s responsibility for your use of the app,
					when you&rsquo;re using the app, it&rsquo;s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to
					ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide
					information to us so that we can make it available to you. Ivan Lobanov accepts no liability for any
					loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the
					app.</p>
				<p class="lb-descriptions">At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available
					on iOS – the requirements for the system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the
					availability of the app to) may change, and you&rsquo;ll need to download the updates if you want to
					keep using the app. Ivan Lobanov does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is
					relevant to you and/or works with the iOS version that you have installed on your device. However,
					you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to
					stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination
					to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to
					you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your
					device.</p>
